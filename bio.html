		<h1>Matthew S. Park</h1>
	</div>
	<p>My name is Matthew S. Park, and I am a senior who is studying Cognitive and Brain Sciences. In addition to having a passion for music and being in a band that has played around the Boston area, I have done research in both social cognition and avian cognition. I am interested in doing research in data acquisition, human learning, cognitive function, and mental disorders. I am currently working on a project which is based upon an auditory learning S/D testing paradigm, in which I am using pigeon vocalizations to learn about their cognition.</p>
