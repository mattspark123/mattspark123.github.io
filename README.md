1) Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

I believe that all parts of my work have been implemented correctly; all pages pass the authenticator tests, and the website works as it should. I don't have any activities related to my major, so I just put my activities that I do in general for the activities section.

2) Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

I showed people outside of the class my website because I was excited. Otherwise, I did everything by myself.
I would like to give credit to w3schools.com for their HTML/CSS tutorials, I used a lot of their articles. Also, the bit of code for centering an image on the page is from their website (lines 35-42 in style.css). I tweaked that code a bit and added a border, just so the image would look better on my website. I also used http://www.cssdesk.com/ to get a live preview of my websites before pushing to github. 

3) Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
I would say maybe 7-10 hours? This includes learning and setting up everything in Lab 3.

4) Be written in either text format (README.txt) or in Markdown (README.md). No other formats will be accepted. Please use all capital letters for README
okay
